******ABOUT******
This was my first completed game. This was submitted as a Brackeys game jam entry. Link: https://itch.io/jam/brackeys-5/rate/928913

******THE GAME******
You are supposed to control a pawn, and you are supposed to hit the blue cubes. 
If you hit one, you score 10 points and your friend is spawnned and it will help you to hit more blue cubes and score more.
If you hit a red cube, you lose 10 points.
If you reach 0 and then hit a red cube again, you are dead. You are either allowed to restart or exit the game.

******BUGS NOTICED******
1. The Cubes don't Spawn properly.
2. The friends keep you blocking.
3. There is a point after which your friends will not move.
4. Friends don't hit the blue cubes, they follow you.
5. The game is super laggy.

So yeah, if anyone can improve the game, tell me! I would love to talk to you people. Reach me out at
